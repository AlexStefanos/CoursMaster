    "We suppose that we have $l$ items each having a utility (or gain) $u_i$. Each of these items has a weight $m_i$. We try to maximize the gain by packing\n",
    "as many items as possible in a maximum capacity bag $M$. We distinguish two interesting cases :\n",
    " - the items are only available in one copy, i.e. we are trying to determine the quantity $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ associated with each item, \n",
    " - one can take several times the same item, i.e. $x_i \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$. The problem is formalized as follows:\n",
