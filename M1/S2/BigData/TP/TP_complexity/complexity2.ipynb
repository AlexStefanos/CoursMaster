    "# Complexity analysis - Practical session 2: NP Completness and the backpack/knapsack problem\n",

    "In this TP we propose to examine different ways of coding and solving problems of the NP class. We are interested in the problem of the backpack.\n",
    "We suppose that we have $l$ items each having a utility (or gain) $u_i$. Each of these items has a weight $m_i$. We try to maximize the gain by packing\n",
    "as many items as possible in a maximum capacity bag $M$. We distinguish two interesting cases :\n",
    " - the items are only available in one copy, i.e. we are trying to determine the quantity $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ associated with each item, \n",
    " - one can take several times the same item, i.e. $x_i \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$. The problem is formalized as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "U & =  \\text{max}_{x_i} \\sum_i x_i u_i \\\\\\\n",
    "    & \\text{s.c.} \\sum_i x_i m_i \\leq M\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine different methods to solve this problem allowing you to feel its complexity. You generate for each test that you will make a utility vector and a vector \n",
    "of weights that will be randomly drawn integers in $[1.10]$. You will set $M$ according to the number of possible items, for example if you have $n$ items (which will be a \n",
    "parameter of your test procedure), you will be able to choose $M=7n$. You will write a function `solve_bag` for each variant that will take the utility, weight and $M$ vectors as parameters and \n",
